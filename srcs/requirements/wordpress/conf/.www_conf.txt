#www.conf

[www] = This defines a new pool named "www". Multiple pools with different configurations in a single PHP-FPM instance.

[user] = Specifies the user under which the PHP-FPM worker processes will run.
    In this case, it's "www-data".

[group] = Specifies the group under which the PHP-FPM worker processes will run.
    In this case, it's also "www-data".

[listen] = Defines the address and port number or socket path where PHP-FPM will listen for incoming requests.
    In this case, it listens on port 9000.

[listen.owner] & [listen.group] = Sets the ownership of the listening socket to the "www-data" user and group.

[pm] = The process manager (pm) mode is set to "dynamic". This means that PHP-FPM will dynamically adjust the number of worker processes based on the current load.

[pm.max_children] = The maximum number of PHP-FPM worker processes allowed for this pool.
    In this case, there can be up to 5 worker processes.

[pm.start_servers] = The number of worker processes to start when PHP-FPM starts up.
    In this case, 2 worker processes will be started.

[pm.min_spare_servers] = The minimum number of idle (spare) worker processes that should be available.
    If there are fewer than this, PHP-FPM will create new worker processes.

[pm.max_spare_servers] = The maximum number of idle (spare) worker processes allowed.
    If there are more than this, PHP-FPM will kill some of the worker processes.

[pm.max_requests] = The maximum number of requests each worker process can serve before it is terminated and replaced by a new worker process.
    This helps prevent memory leaks and other issues that may arise from long-running processes.

[clear_env] = Specifies whether to clear environment variables for each worker process.
    By setting this to "no", the worker processes will inherit the environment variables from the PHP-FPM process.
